# Moleskine
A simple HTML-App to demo LocalStorage. 

It takes notes and stores them into the LocalStorage of the browser. It is possible to delete the notes afterwards. Existing items on LocalStorage should be displayed when the page is loaded.

Has a toastr that displays information about the application.

This application includes [the alpha of Bootstraps version 5](https://v5.getbootstrap.com/) for the UI design. Therefore, the app cannot be displayed in Internet Explorer, [which is no longer supported](https://v5.getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/browsers-devices/#internet-explorer).

## How to start
Grep the latest version from [Releases](https://github.com/work-gkn/moleskine/releases) and unpack it elsewhere on your drive. The index.html file could be open directly in the browser.
